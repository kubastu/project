| ----------- |----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--- |
| 1 | How to Include Persistence | Whether to use Docker or not                  | Save to local database         | Meet Project Rubric Requirements
| 2 | Parsing Json               | Came up with dependency to parse Json in Java | Jave does not have Json reader | To make sure we address all of professor's comments
| 3 | Which Tests to Include     | Read the Spring Boot chapter on Tests         | See project examples           | To demonstrate the database works
