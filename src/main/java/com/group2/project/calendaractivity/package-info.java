/**
 * <b>This package defines Java classes that are responsible for communicating with the calendarActivity.fxml file.
 * <ul>
 * <li> {CalendarActivity} defines a Java object class that acts as a high-level, generic 'internal' data structure for sake of storing data in the CalendarController.java
 * <li> {CalendarController} defines a Java class that controls all functionality of the calendarActivity.fxml. This includes initialization, reading user-inputted data, along with displaying user-inputted data.
 * </ul>
