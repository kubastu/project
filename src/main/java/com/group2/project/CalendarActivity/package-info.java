/**
 * <b>This package defines Java classes that are responsible for communicating with the calendarActivity.fxml file.
 * <ul>
 * <li> CalendarActivity defines a Java object class that acts as a generic 'internal' data structure for sake of storing data in the CalendarController.java
 * <li> CalendarController defines a java class that controls all functionality of the calendarActivity.fxml. This includes initialization, reading user-inputted data, along with displaying user-inputted data.
