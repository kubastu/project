/**
 * <b>Demonstrate my knowledge I have acquired from the class
 * <ul>
 * <li> For CRUD operations and SQL I used java persistence api (jpa) and crud repository
 * <li> Included 2 repositories; mongo and jpa
 * <li> I included relational database for Relation.java to avoid circular dependencies
 * <li> For logging I used lombok
 * <li> Added unit tests to demonstrate repository working using JUnit
 * <li> All my tests are under ../test/java/com.group2.project/addressbook
 * <li> For RESTful service used lombok
 * <li> Combined SQL with NoSQL. Used Mongo for NoSQL. Used PostGres for SQL. I ran PostGres and Mongo with Docker
 * </ul>
